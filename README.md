# Danny's Digital Packet (DDP)

A protocol designed to be used as alternative to packet radio which interfaces with fldigi, RS-232, or D-STAR DV to provide the backend. Packets are sent and received in plain text so they can be seen by eye (on the waterfall, console, etc) and also for ease of use and implementation.

Designed to work with ANY transceiver that can be interfaced to your computer using fldigi, RS-232, or using any compatible D-STAR DV rig.
